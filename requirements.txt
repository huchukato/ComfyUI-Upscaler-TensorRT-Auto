# Base dependencies - TensorRT will be auto-installed based on CUDA detection
# The node will automatically detect CUDA 12/13 and install appropriate TensorRT packages
# 
# Installation happens automatically when the node loads for the first time
# No manual TensorRT installation required!

# Note: TensorRT packages are auto-installed on first node load:
# CUDA 13: tensorrt_cu13==10.15.1.29 (RTX 50 series)
# CUDA 12: tensorrt-cu12==10.13.3.9 (RTX 30/40 series)
